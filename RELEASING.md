# Releasing

This document summarizes the process of doing a new release of this project.
Release can only be performed by Datadog maintainers of this repository.

## Schedule
This project does not have a strict release schedule. However, we would make a release at least every 2 months.
  - No release will be done if no changes got merged to the `master` branch during the above mentioned window.
  - Releases may be done more frequently than the above mentioned window.

## Make Sure Everything Works

* Make sure tests are passing.
* Build the package locally (e.g. `mvn clean install`), and play around with it a bit.
