**groups** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | A list of (up to 20) monitor groups (e.g. [\&quot;env:prod,role:mysql\&quot;]) that narrows the scope of a monitor service level objective.

Optional in create/update requests for monitor service level objectives, but may only be used when then length of the \&quot;monitor_ids\&quot; field is one. |  [optional]
**id** | **String** | A unique identifier for the service level objective object.  Always included in service level objective responses. Required for update requests. |  [optional]
**modifiedAt** | **Long** | Modification timestamp (unix time in seconds)  Always included in service level objective responses. |  [optional] [readonly]
**monitorIds** | **List&lt;Long&gt;** | A list of monitor ids that defines the scope of a monitor service level objective.  Required if type is \&quot;monitor\&quot;. |  [optional]
**monitorTags** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | The union of monitor tags for all monitors referenced by the \&quot;monitor_ids\&quot; field.

**thresholds** | [**List&lt;SLOThreshold&gt;**](SLOThreshold.md) | The thresholds (timeframes and associated targets) for this service level objective object. | 
**type** | [**ServiceLevelObjectiveType**](ServiceLevelObjectiveType.md) |  | 
**typeId** | [**ServiceLevelObjectiveTypeNumeric**](ServiceLevelObjectiveTypeNumeric.md) |  |  [optional]
