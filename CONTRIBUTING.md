# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository.
To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR.

As most of the code in this repository is generated, we will only accept PRs for files
that are not modified by our code-generation machinery (changes to the generated files
would get overwritten). We happily accept contributions to files that are listed in:

* `.openapi-generator-ignore`

as well as the following files:

* `pom.xml`
* `README.md`
* `src/test/*`

## Submitting issues

* If you have a feature request, you should [contact support][1] so the request
can be properly tracked.
* If you can't find anything useful, please contact our [support][1].
* Finally, you can open a Github issue.

## Pull Requests

Have you fixed a bug or written a new resource and want to share it? Many thanks!

In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve
when submitting your PR:

* Have a [proper commit history](#commits) (we advise you to rebase if needed).
* Write tests for the code you wrote.
* Make sure that all tests pass locally.
* Summarize your PR with a meaningful title, [see later on this doc](#pull-request-title).

Your pull request must pass all CI tests. If you're seeing
an error and don't think it's your fault, it may not be! [Join us on Slack][2]
or send us an email, and together we'll get it sorted out.

### Keep it small, focused

Avoid changing too many things at once. For instance if you're fixing two different
resources at once, it makes reviewing harder.

### Pull Request title

The title must be concise but explanatory. This aids in the reviewing process and helps when creating meaningful changelogs.

### Commit Messages

Please don't be this person: `git commit -m "Fixed stuff"`. Take a moment to
write meaningful commit messages.

The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details
that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you've been
working on for a day.

### Squash your commits

Please rebase your changes on `master` and squash your commits whenever possible,
it keeps history cleaner and it's easier to revert things. It also makes developers
happier!
